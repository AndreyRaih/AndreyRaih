## Hey there! 👋
Welcome to my GitHub profile where I showcase my favorite pet-projects - all open-sourced for you to explore and use!

A little about me:

- 🌐 I have around 5 years of experience in Frontend, with a focus on React.js/Vue.js
- 📱 Experienced in mobile development with Cordova, ReactNative, and Flutter
- 📖 I am constantly improving my skills and love sharing knowledge with others - I also have experience mentoring others
- ⚙️ I'm a big fan of a reverse-engineering approach when studying Frontend solutions.

Thanks for stopping by! 😃
